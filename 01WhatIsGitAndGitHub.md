# What is Git?
Git is a version control system â€” it helps you track changes in your files, especially code, and work with others on the same project without messing things up.
  
- Think of it like this: You're writing a project report in your college. Every time you update it, you make a copy like:
```
reportv1.doc
```
```
reportv2.doc
```
```
reportv2updated.doc
```
```
reportv2final.doc
```
This gets confusing, right?ðŸ¤¯ Copying everytime when you make changes, keeping older version to track changes or you want to move older version. Really tricky right?ðŸ¤¯

Now imagine a tool that:  
âœ… Tracks all changes  
âœ… Lets you go back to old versions  
âœ… Allows your friends to collabrate   
âœ… Shows who made what change  

Thatâ€™s exactly what Git does â€” but for code!

# What is Github
GitHub is a website and cloud platform where you can store, share, and collaborate on Git projects online. Git is a tool on your computer that tracks changes in your code. GitHub is a place on the internet where you can upload (push) that code

ðŸ“¦ Think of it like this:  
-  Youâ€™re working on a college project.
-  You use Git on your laptop to save progress.
-  Now you want your friend to help from another city.
-  So you upload it to GitHub.

-  Your friend clones it, works on it, and pushes changes back.
-  You can both work on the same project without emailing files!
